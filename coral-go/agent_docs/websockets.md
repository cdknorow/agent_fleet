# WebSocket API

Coral provides two WebSocket endpoints for real-time streaming.

---

## `/ws/coral` — Session List Streaming

Streams the live session list with diff-based updates to minimize bandwidth.

### Connection

```
ws://localhost:8420/ws/coral
```

No query parameters required.

### Message Flow

**First message** — full snapshot of all sessions:

```json
{
  "type": "coral_update",
  "sessions": [
    {
      "name": "my-project",
      "agent_type": "claude",
      "session_id": "abc123-uuid",
      "tmux_session": "coral_claude_abc123",
      "status": "Working",
      "summary": "Implementing feature X",
      "staleness_seconds": 5,
      "display_name": "Custom Name",
      "icon": "🤖",
      "working_directory": "/home/user/project",
      "waiting_for_input": false,
      "done": false,
      "waiting_reason": null,
      "waiting_summary": null,
      "working": true,
      "stuck": false,
      "changed_file_count": 3,
      "commands": {"compress": "/compact", "clear": "/clear"},
      "board_project": "my-board",
      "board_job_title": "Task Title",
      "board_unread": 0,
      "log_path": "/path/to/log",
      "sleeping": false
    }
  ],
  "active_runs": []
}
```

**Subsequent messages** — only changes since last update:

```json
{
  "type": "coral_diff",
  "changed": [
    { /* full session object for each changed session */ }
  ],
  "removed": ["session-id-1", "session-id-2"],
  "active_runs": [/* only included if runs changed */]
}
```

- `changed`: Full session objects for sessions whose state changed (no field-level diffs).
- `removed`: Session IDs that are no longer live.
- `active_runs`: Only sent when the active runs list changes.

If nothing changed since the last poll, no message is sent.

### Poll Interval

Configurable via `WSPollIntervalS` in server config. Default: **5 seconds**.

### Session Status Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `status` | string | Human-readable status from log parsing |
| `summary` | string | Current activity summary |
| `staleness_seconds` | float | Seconds since last log activity |
| `waiting_for_input` | bool | Agent is waiting for user input (notification event) |
| `done` | bool | Agent has stopped (stop event) |
| `working` | bool | Agent is actively running tools |
| `stuck` | bool | Reserved (currently always false) |
| `sleeping` | bool | Session is in sleep state |
| `changed_file_count` | int | Number of files changed by agent |
| `board_project` | string | Associated message board name |
| `board_unread` | int | Unread board messages |

---

## `/ws/terminal/{name}` — Terminal Streaming

Bidirectional WebSocket for real-time terminal interaction. Both PTY and tmux backends use the same unified streaming protocol — raw byte output delivered as binary WebSocket frames.

### Connection

```
ws://localhost:8420/ws/terminal/{name}
```

### Client → Server Messages (JSON text frames)

**Send terminal input:**
```json
{
  "type": "terminal_input",
  "data": "ls -la\n"
}
```

**Resize terminal:**
```json
{
  "type": "terminal_resize",
  "cols": 120,
  "rows": 30
}
```

### Server → Client Messages

**Stream data (binary frames):**

Raw terminal output bytes sent as binary WebSocket frames (`MessageBinary`). The client should set `ws.binaryType = 'arraybuffer'` and write directly to xterm.js:

```js
ws.onmessage = (event) => {
  if (event.data instanceof ArrayBuffer) {
    terminal.write(new Uint8Array(event.data));
  } else {
    // JSON control message
    const msg = JSON.parse(event.data);
    // handle terminal_closed, etc.
  }
};
```

On connect, the server sends an initial replay seed (last ~256 KiB of output, configurable via `terminal_replay_bytes` setting) as a binary frame, prefixed with clear codes (`\x1b[2J\x1b[3J\x1b[H`) to prevent scrollback duplication on reconnect.

**Terminal closed (JSON text frame):**

Sent when the session ends:
```json
{
  "type": "terminal_closed"
}
```

### Backend Behavior

Both backends implement the same `Attach`/`Replay` interface:

- **PTY backend** (Windows): In-process fan-out from PTY read loop. 256 KiB ring buffer for replay.
- **Tmux backend** (macOS/Linux): Tails the pipe-pane log file via fsnotify. Replay reads the last N bytes of the log file.

Multiple WebSocket clients can attach to the same session simultaneously. Input from any client is serialized to the terminal. Resize is last-writer-wins.

---

## Origin Validation

Both WebSocket endpoints validate the `Origin` header:

- **Localhost** connections are always allowed (`localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `[::1]`).
- **Same-origin** requests (where Origin host matches the request Host) are allowed for remote access.
- The request's `Host` header is added as an allowed origin pattern for remote access scenarios.

---

## Authentication

WebSocket connections go through the same auth middleware as REST endpoints:

- **Localhost**: Auth bypassed.
- **Remote**: Requires API key (passed as a cookie or query parameter by the frontend).
